Briefly, CallStack is the list of functions that are supposed to run by the interpreter for visual content we have a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHNtqjiA-8z/\">post</a> about this you might like to check that out.</p>\n<p>The Call Stack you can imagine it as the place where a function is executed one by one that is it forms a stack of functions that are happening in the program, you can go and visualize this in the Chrome browsers inspect tool and then to the sources tab where you can add a snippet and then run the code and there is a column to the right where you can see the Call Stack and it displays each process.</p>\n<p>How the call stack works is that when you start to execute a program and a function is called and goes onto the call stack after that the function returns something and then it is popped off the stack, after that another function is put on the stack and the same process continues until the whole program is executed.</p>\n<p>There are certain limitations to the call stack for adding functions and when the limit is over there is a stack overflow.</p>\n<h2>Memory Heap</h2>\n<p>The Memory Heap is the block of place where you can store the variables, objects, arrays, and other stuff that is, it is just a place to store things. Similarly, when we start writing code the memory will get filled and because memory is limited then it will cause memory leaks.</p>\n<h2>Single-Threaded</h2>\n<p>You might have heard of Js being a single-threaded language that means it is synchronous (it can only perform one task at a time ) it can't perform multiple tasks at one time as we have seen in the call stack. But the problem with that is we can't do multiple things simultaneously and this will create a lot of difficulties if only one task a user can perform on a browser at a time.</p>\n<h2>JavaScript Runtime</h2>\n<p>To resolve this issue we use something called a JavaScript Runtime which helps in running Asynchronous code and it comes along with the Js engine with the browser. From the image given, there are a lot of things happening in this particular picture and we are going to understand the complete picture of how things are going to be done.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
